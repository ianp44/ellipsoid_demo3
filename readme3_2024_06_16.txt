Please note if you
download all the files,
the javascript files

vects2_demo1_5.js

and

vects1_5_beta3.js

have to do in a subdirectory/folder
called 

dev

(
or you can edit the
javascript inlcude
statements in
the main .html file.
)


I'll put up instructions
how to get these files
to work soon.

They are mainly going up
in a hurry to protect
my copyright etc.

see my website
www.pouncy.co.uk
for a possibly more
user friedly
demo.
(Time of writing
16/6/24)

The files need tidied up
enormoously but the code
does work..
